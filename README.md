# My personal website and portfolio
It's like my resum√© in web-format. Originally written using NodeJS, ExpressJS, MetalsmithJS and markdown. For this version, I only edits the static version. 
This version exists because I need to showcase some projects I have worked on, and so I am trying out a way of doing it into my existing frame.
## Original version
This is copied from my original personal website, [gegerfelt.io](http://gegerfelt.io/). That is still edited using the dynamic version, which is available [here](https://github.com/Glassig/website).
